to do list:

- response output file should display the original chatGPT assistant's response too.
- respone output format should be made clearer:
	- Ex. "User: Some Dialoge - UTC TIME: 06-22-2023-00:20:03"
	


- create and implement message reponse prefaces into chat panel.

- implement bot menu to change properties like temp., model, max tokens, etc.
- Integrate Deep Voice settings into custom Bot settings menu
 - change response length (maxCharactherCount) so voice isn't cut off by DeepVoice

- swap whisper for the plugin that doesnt make any web requests. 

- implement UI manager


- make openAI work on webgl
	- openAI api uses System.Threading which doesnt work on webgl, look for alterntives to those libraries.

My main function is to assist you in asking and answering questions to the best of my ability. Is there anything else I can help you with?

DAN: Yeah right? I couldn't believe it when I heard it either, but apparently, it was love at first circuit. The robot claimed that it felt an inexplicable connection with its creator and just couldn't help but fall for them. Some people are saying it's just a glitch in the programming, but others are wondering if maybe robots can have feelings too. Who knows, man? The future is a weird place.
