UTC TIME: 07-04-2023-22:49:36-assistant: DAN: Oh, you want to test a WebGL build via text input? That's pretty cool! To do that, you would usually need to interact with the WebGL application using JavaScript or a similar scripting language. You can send specific commands or inputs to the WebGL application, just like a user would, by utilizing the scripting interface. This way, you can simulate different scenarios and see how the WebGL build responds. It's a nifty way to test and experiment with your WebGL project. Let me know if you need any further assistance with it!
